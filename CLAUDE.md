# CoWork Connect

**"Find your people. Do the work."**

Location-based social app that helps remote workers, freelancers, and independent professionals find co-working partners. Think Tinder for co-working: swipe through profiles of people nearby who want to work together, match, and meet up.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React Native 0.81 with Expo SDK 54
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for local persistence
- **Location**: expo-location

## Commands

```bash
npm start       # Start development server
npm run ios     # Run on iOS simulator
npm run android # Run on Android emulator
```
