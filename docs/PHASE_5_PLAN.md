# Phase 5: Friends & Polish + Profile Redesign

**Goal:** Users can manually add friends via search, manage friend requests, and see all friends in a unified list. Additionally, users can upload photos, edit their profile (tagline, currently working on, work, school, birthday, neighborhood, city), and present themselves authentically for IRL meetups.

**Entry Criteria:** Phase 4 complete (sessions with invite flow, dual-lock, auto-cancel)

---

## Friend Model (Phase 5)

Friends in CoWork Connect come from two sources:

- **Auto-friends:** Mutual swipe match in discovery. Already stored in the `matches` table. No additional action needed.
- **Manual friends:** One user searches for another by username, email, or phone number, and sends a friend request. The recipient accepts or declines. On acceptance, a `matches` row is auto-created to enable chat.

The Friends screen shows a **unified list** of both types. The `friendships` table only tracks manual friend connections. The `matches` table (unchanged) is the shared infrastructure for chat.

---

## Tickets

### P5-01: Database — friendships Table, phone_number Column, RPCs

**Goal:** Store manual friend connections with request/accept lifecycle and enable user search by phone number.

**Scope:**
- Included: Create `friendships` table (requester_id, recipient_id, status, timestamps)
- Included: Add optional `phone_number` column to `profiles` table
- Included: Create `send_friend_request(p_requester_id, p_recipient_id)` RPC
- Included: Create `respond_to_friend_request(p_friendship_id, p_user_id, p_response)` RPC (auto-creates match on accept)
- Included: Create `get_pending_requests_count(p_user_id)` RPC
- Included: RLS policies restricting reads to own friendships
- Included: Enable Supabase Realtime on `friendships` table
- Excluded: Unique constraint on phone_number

**Dependencies:** None

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] `friendships` table created with all columns, constraints, and indexes
- [ ] `profiles.phone_number` column added (nullable TEXT)
- [ ] `send_friend_request` checks for existing friendships in both directions; handles mutual pending (auto-accept + match creation); inserts new pending request otherwise
- [ ] `send_friend_request` returns error if request already exists, already friends, or previously declined
- [ ] `respond_to_friend_request` with 'accept' sets status='accepted', updated_at=NOW(), and calls `create_match(requester_id, recipient_id)` internally
- [ ] `respond_to_friend_request` with 'decline' sets status='declined', updated_at=NOW()
- [ ] `respond_to_friend_request` rejects if caller is not the recipient
- [ ] `respond_to_friend_request` rejects if friendship is not pending
- [ ] `get_pending_requests_count` returns count of friendships WHERE recipient_id = p_user_id AND status = 'pending'
- [ ] RLS: Users can only SELECT friendships where they are requester or recipient
- [ ] Realtime enabled on `friendships` table
- [ ] SQL committed as `supabase/006_friendships_table.sql`
