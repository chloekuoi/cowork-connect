5. Pull to refresh or reopen Discover tab

**Common Failures:**
| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "No one nearby" | No other users with intents | Create test data (see above) |
| Cards show wrong distance | Test user too far | Use coordinates within 50km |
| Blank cards | Missing profile data | Check `profiles` table has name |

---

### 5. Swipe Left / Right

**Preconditions:** Discovery feed showing with cards

**Steps — Gesture Swipe:**
1. Touch and drag card horizontally
2. See card rotate and stamp appear:
   - Right drag → green "LIKE" stamp
   - Left drag → red "NOPE" stamp
3. Release past threshold → card flies off
4. Release before threshold → card springs back

**Steps — Button Swipe:**
1. Tap X button (left side) → swipe left
2. Tap OK button (right side) → swipe right

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Card rotates while dragging (max ±15°)
- [ ] LIKE/NOPE stamps fade in based on direction
- [ ] Swiping past 30% screen width completes swipe
- [ ] Card animates off screen smoothly
- [ ] Next card scales up to replace it
- [ ] Check Supabase: `swipes` table has new row with:
  - `swiper_id` = your user ID
  - `swiped_id` = swiped user's ID
  - `direction` = "right" or "left"
  - `swipe_date` = today

**Match Detection:**
1. User A swipes right on User B
2. User B swipes right on User A
3. User B sees: Alert "It's a Match!"

**To Test Match:**
1. With User A: swipe right on User B
2. Log out, log in as User B
3. Find User A in feed, swipe right
4. **Expected:** Alert appears: "It's a Match! You and [name] both want to co-work today!"

**Common Failures:**
| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Card doesn't move | Gesture not registering | Ensure GestureHandlerRootView wraps app |
| No snap back | Animation broken | Check reanimated babel plugin |
| Swipe not recorded | Database error | Check Supabase `swipes` RLS policies |
| No match alert | RPC not created | Run `check_match` function SQL |
| Match alert for every swipe | Mutual swipe exists | Expected if both swiped right |

---

### 6. Messaging

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED (Phase 3)

**Placeholder Behavior:**
- Matches tab exists but shows placeholder content
- No chat functionality yet
- No way to communicate after matching

**Coming in Phase 3:**
- Match list with last message preview
- 1:1 chat thread
- Push notifications for new messages
- Typing indicators

# Phase 3: Matching & Messaging — Verification Flows

**Added:** 2026-02-07

---

## Database Setup (Phase 3)

Before testing Phase 3, run the SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

3. `supabase/003_matching_tables.sql` — matches table, messages table, create_match, mark_chat_read

After running, verify:
1. Go to Table Editor → verify `matches` and `messages` tables exist
2. Go to Authentication → Policies → verify RLS policies on both tables
3. Go to Database → Functions → verify `create_match` and `mark_chat_read` exist
4. Go to Database → Replication → verify `messages` table has Realtime enabled

---

### 7. Verify Phase 3 Database

**Preconditions:** SQL migration `003_matching_tables.sql` executed

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run: `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';`
3. **Expected:** `matches` and `messages` listed alongside existing tables
4. Run: `SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_schema = 'public';`
5. **Expected:** `create_match` and `mark_chat_read` listed alongside `check_match` and `handle_new_user`
6. Run: `SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename IN ('matches', 'messages');`
7. **Expected:** RLS policies listed for both tables
8. Test create_match function:
   ```sql
   -- Use two existing user IDs from profiles table
   SELECT create_match('USER_A_UUID'::uuid, 'USER_B_UUID'::uuid);
   ```
9. **Expected:** Returns a UUID (the match ID)
10. Run the same call again
11. **Expected:** Returns the same UUID (idempotent)
12. Check matches table: `SELECT * FROM matches;`
13. **Expected:** One row with ordered user IDs

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "function create_match does not exist" | SQL not run | Execute `003_matching_tables.sql` |
| "permission denied for table matches" | RLS blocking | Verify SECURITY DEFINER on functions |
| Realtime not working | Not enabled | Dashboard → Database → Replication → enable `messages` |

---

### 8. Match Creation via Swipe

**Preconditions:** Both users have accounts, Phase 3 database set up, both users have today's intents

**Steps:**

13. Check Supabase `matches` table
14. **Expected:** New row with user1_id=LEAST(A,B), user2_id=GREATEST(A,B)

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No match row after mutual swipe | `create_match` not called in recordSwipe | Check discoveryService.ts update |
| Duplicate match rows | User ordering not working | Check `create_match` function uses LEAST/GREATEST |
| Match row but no modal | Modal not integrated | Check DiscoverScreen uses MatchModal |

---

### 9. Match Modal

**Preconditions:** Mutual right swipe scenario (User B triggers the match)

**Steps:**
1. As User B, swipe right on User A (who already swiped right on B)
2. **Expected:** Match modal appears (NOT native Alert)
3. Verify modal shows:
   - Both users' photos or initials
   - "It's a Match!" heading
   - Subtitle with both names

## Phase 3 Debugging Tips

### Check Realtime
1. Supabase Dashboard → Database → Replication
2. Verify `messages` table is listed under "Source"
3. If not listed, enable it and restart the app

### Check Match Functions
```sql
-- Test create_match directly
SELECT create_match('USER_A_UUID'::uuid, 'USER_B_UUID'::uuid);

-- Test mark_chat_read directly
SELECT mark_chat_read('MATCH_UUID'::uuid, 'USER_UUID'::uuid);

-- Check unread messages for a user
SELECT m.id, m.content, m.created_at, m.sender_id
FROM messages m
JOIN matches mt ON m.match_id = mt.id
WHERE (mt.user1_id = 'USER_UUID' AND m.created_at > mt.user1_last_read_at AND m.sender_id != 'USER_UUID')
   OR (mt.user2_id = 'USER_UUID' AND m.created_at > mt.user2_last_read_at AND m.sender_id != 'USER_UUID');
```

### Common Phase 3 Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Realtime not delivering messages | Enable Realtime on `messages` table in Supabase Dashboard |
| "function create_match does not exist" | Run `supabase/003_matching_tables.sql` |
| Messages visible to wrong users | Check RLS policies on `messages` table |
| Chat opens but shows wrong messages | Verify `match_id` filter on message query |
| Badge count wrong after reading | Check `mark_chat_read` updates correct column (user1 vs user2) |
| Navigation crash from modal | Check MatchesStack navigator has correct screen names |

# Phase 4: Sessions — Verification Flows

**Added:** 2026-02-08

---

## Database Setup (Phase 4)

Before testing Phase 4, run the SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

4. `supabase/004_sessions_tables.sql` — sessions table, session_participants table, all session RPC functions

After running, verify:
1. Go to Table Editor → verify `sessions` and `session_participants` tables exist
2. Go to Authentication → Policies → verify RLS policies on both tables
3. Go to Database → Functions → verify `create_session`, `respond_to_session`, `complete_session`, `cancel_session`, `auto_complete_sessions` exist
4. Go to Database → Replication → verify `sessions` table has Realtime enabled

---

### 13. Verify Phase 4 Database

**Preconditions:** SQL migration `004_sessions_tables.sql` executed

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run: `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';`
3. **Expected:** `sessions` and `session_participants` listed alongside existing tables
4. Run: `SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_schema = 'public';`
5. **Expected:** `create_session`, `respond_to_session`, `complete_session`, `cancel_session`, `auto_complete_sessions` listed
6. Run: `SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename IN ('sessions', 'session_participants');`
7. **Expected:** RLS policies listed for both tables
8. Test create_session function (use two user IDs from an existing match):
   ```sql
   -- First, find a match
   SELECT id, user1_id, user2_id FROM matches LIMIT 1;
   -- Then create a session (use match_id and user1_id from above)
   SELECT create_session('MATCH_UUID'::uuid, 'USER1_UUID'::uuid);
   ```
9. **Expected:** Returns a UUID (the session ID)
10. Check sessions table: `SELECT * FROM sessions;`
11. **Expected:** One row with status='pending', initiated_by=USER1
12. Check session_participants: `SELECT * FROM session_participants;`
13. **Expected:** Two rows — one 'initiator', one 'invitee'
14. Try creating another session for the same user:
    ```sql
    SELECT create_session('MATCH_UUID'::uuid, 'USER1_UUID'::uuid);
    ```
15. **Expected:** Error — "User already has an active or pending session"
16. Test respond_to_session:
    ```sql
    SELECT respond_to_session('SESSION_UUID'::uuid, 'USER2_UUID'::uuid, 'accept');
    ```
17. **Expected:** Session status changes to 'active', accepted_at is set
18. Test complete_session:
    ```sql
    SELECT complete_session('SESSION_UUID'::uuid, 'USER1_UUID'::uuid);
    ```
19. **Expected:** Session status changes to 'completed', completed_at is set

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "function create_session does not exist" | SQL not run | Execute `004_sessions_tables.sql` |
| "permission denied for table sessions" | RLS blocking | Verify SECURITY DEFINER on functions |
| Realtime not working for sessions | Not enabled | Dashboard → Database → Replication → enable `sessions` |
| "User already has an active or pending session" | Previous test data | Clean up: `DELETE FROM sessions;` |

|---------|-------|-----|
| "View Session" doesn't navigate | Navigation not set up | Check MatchesStack has ActiveSession screen |
| Active Session screen blank | Route params not passed | Check sessionId and otherUser params |
| "End Session" error | completeSession RPC issue | Check function exists and user is participant |
| Duration shows wrong value | Calculation error | Check accepted_at and completed_at difference |
| "Back to Chat" navigates wrong | Navigation stack issue | Check popToTop or navigate behavior |

---

### 17. Cancel Invite

**Preconditions:** User A has a pending session with User B

**Steps:**
1. Login as User A
2. Open chat with User B
3. Find the pending session card (initiator view)
4. **Expected:** "Cancel" button visible
5. Tap "Cancel"
6. **Expected:** Card updates to "Session Cancelled" (dimmed)
7. Check Supabase: status='cancelled'
8. **Expected:** "Send Cowork Invite" button available again in chat header
9. Login as User B
10. Open chat with User A
11. **Expected:** Session card shows "Session Cancelled" (no action buttons)

**Invitee Cannot Cancel:**
1. Create a new pending session (User A invites User B)
2. Login as User B, view the session card
3. **Expected:** No "Cancel" button visible — only "Accept" and "Decline"

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Cancel button visible for invitee | Role check missing in component | Check currentUserId vs initiated_by |
| "Session not found or not pending" | Session already accepted/declined | Check status before cancel |
| Card doesn't update | State not refreshed | Check Realtime subscription or manual refetch |

---

### 18. Auto-Cancel Stale Sessions

**Preconditions:** An active session exists with accepted_at older than 24 hours and not fully locked

**Setup (via Supabase SQL Editor):**
```sql
-- Create a session and manually set its date to yesterday
UPDATE sessions
SET status = 'active',
    accepted_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day',
    locked_by_initiator_at = NULL,
    locked_by_invitee_at = NULL
WHERE id = 'SESSION_UUID';
```

**Steps:**
1. Close and reopen the app (or login fresh)
2. **Expected:** Auto-cancel runs silently on app load
3. Check Supabase `sessions` table
4. **Expected:** Session status changed to 'cancelled', completed_ack=false
5. **Expected:** Lock timestamps cleared
6. Open the affected chat on User A and User B
7. **Expected:** Toast appears for 3 seconds: "Missed this one 💔"

**Alternative Manual Test:**
```sql
-- Call the RPC directly
SELECT auto_cancel_sessions();
-- Expected: Returns number of sessions cancelled (e.g., 1)
```

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Stale session still active | auto_cancel_sessions not called on app load | Check AuthContext or root navigator |
| Function returns 0 | accepted_at not older than 24h | Verify accepted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours' |
| App crashes on load | Auto-complete error not caught | Ensure fire-and-forget with try/catch |

---

### 19. Multiple Pending Invites

**Preconditions:** User A has matches with both User B and User C

**Steps:**
1. Login as User A
2. Open chat with User B
3. Tap "Send Cowork Invite" → invite created (pending)
4. Navigate back, open chat with User C
5. **Expected:** "Send Cowork Invite" is still available
6. Send invite to User C
7. **Expected:** Both invites remain pending in respective chats

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Invite blocked | Old one-per-user constraint still enforced | Update create_session RPC |

---

## Phase 4 Debugging Tips

### Check Session Functions
```sql
-- Test create_session directly (use real match and user IDs)
SELECT create_session('MATCH_UUID'::uuid, 'USER_UUID'::uuid);

-- Test respond_to_session
SELECT respond_to_session('SESSION_UUID'::uuid, 'INVITEE_UUID'::uuid, 'accept');

-- Test complete_session
SELECT complete_session('SESSION_UUID'::uuid, 'USER_UUID'::uuid);

-- Test cancel_session
SELECT cancel_session('SESSION_UUID'::uuid, 'INITIATOR_UUID'::uuid);

-- Test auto_complete
SELECT auto_complete_sessions();

-- Check all sessions
SELECT s.id, s.status, s.session_date, s.initiated_by, s.accepted_at, s.completed_at,
       p1.name as initiator_name
FROM sessions s
JOIN profiles p1 ON s.initiated_by = p1.id
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;

-- Check session participants
SELECT sp.session_id, sp.role, p.name
FROM session_participants sp
JOIN profiles p ON sp.user_id = p.id;

-- Check one-per-user constraint
SELECT sp.user_id, p.name, s.status, s.session_date
FROM session_participants sp
JOIN sessions s ON sp.session_id = s.id
JOIN profiles p ON sp.user_id = p.id
WHERE s.status IN ('pending', 'active');
```

### Common Phase 4 Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "function create_session does not exist" | Run `supabase/004_sessions_tables.sql` |
| Realtime not delivering session updates | Enable Realtime on `sessions` table in Dashboard |
| Session card not updating in chat | Check Realtime subscription on session id |
| "Start Session" always disabled | Check fetchActiveSession query — may return stale data |
| Session card at wrong position in chat | Check created_at sorting in timeline merge |
| Duration shows negative or NaN | Check accepted_at and completed_at are both non-null |
| Auto-complete not running | Check AuthContext calls autoCompleteStaleSessions after auth |

# Phase 5: Friends & Polish — Verification Flows

**Added:** 2026-02-15

---

## Database Setup (Phase 5)

Before testing Phase 5, run the SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

6. `supabase/006_friendships_table.sql` — friendships table, phone_number column on profiles, friend RPCs

After running, verify:
1. Go to Table Editor → verify `friendships` table exists
2. Go to Table Editor → verify `profiles` table has `phone_number` column
3. Go to Authentication → Policies → verify RLS policy on `friendships` table
4. Go to Database → Functions → verify `send_friend_request`, `respond_to_friend_request`, `get_pending_requests_count` exist
5. Go to Database → Replication → verify `friendships` table has Realtime enabled

---

### 20. Verify Phase 5 Database

**Preconditions:** SQL migration `006_friendships_table.sql` executed

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run: `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';`
3. **Expected:** `friendships` listed alongside existing tables
4. Run: `SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name = 'phone_number';`
5. **Expected:** One row: `phone_number`, `text`
6. Run: `SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_schema = 'public';`
7. **Expected:** `send_friend_request`, `respond_to_friend_request`, `get_pending_requests_count` listed
8. Run: `SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'friendships';`
9. **Expected:** At least one RLS policy listed
10. Test send_friend_request:
    ```sql
    -- Use two existing user IDs from profiles table
    SELECT send_friend_request('USER_A_UUID'::uuid, 'USER_B_UUID'::uuid);
    ```
11. **Expected:** Returns a UUID (the friendship ID)
12. Check friendships table: `SELECT * FROM friendships;`
13. **Expected:** One row with requester_id=A, recipient_id=B, status='pending'
14. Test respond_to_friend_request:
    ```sql
    SELECT respond_to_friend_request('FRIENDSHIP_UUID'::uuid, 'USER_B_UUID'::uuid, 'accept');
    ```
15. **Expected:** No error. Friendship status changes to 'accepted'.
16. Check matches table: `SELECT * FROM matches WHERE user1_id = LEAST('USER_A_UUID', 'USER_B_UUID')::uuid AND user2_id = GREATEST('USER_A_UUID', 'USER_B_UUID')::uuid;`
17. **Expected:** A match row exists (created by accept)
18. Test get_pending_requests_count:
    ```sql
    SELECT get_pending_requests_count('USER_B_UUID'::uuid);
    ```
19. **Expected:** Returns 0 (no pending requests left)

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "function send_friend_request does not exist" | SQL not run | Execute `006_friendships_table.sql` |
| "permission denied for table friendships" | RLS blocking | Verify SECURITY DEFINER on functions |
| Match not created on accept | `create_match` not called inside RPC | Check `respond_to_friend_request` function body |
| Duplicate friendship error | Previous test data | Clean up: `DELETE FROM friendships;` |

---

### 21. Search Users and Send Friend Request

**Preconditions:** At least two user accounts exist; User B has set email and/or phone_number on their profile

**Steps:**

13. Navigate back to Profile tab
14. **Expected:** Badge gone (0 pending requests)
15. Login as User A, navigate to My Friends
16. **Expected:** User B appears in friends list

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No badge on Profile tab | getPendingRequestsCount not called on focus | Check MainTabs useFocusEffect |
| Badge shows wrong number | Count query incorrect | Check get_pending_requests_count RPC |
| Accept does nothing | respondToFriendRequest not called | Check onAccept handler |

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Decline does nothing | respondToFriendRequest not called | Check onDecline handler |
| Request card still visible after decline | State not refreshed | Check local state removal |
| User A can still send request | "Declined" status not checked in search | Check getRelationshipStatuses logic |

---

### 24. Mutual Request Auto-Accept

**Preconditions:** User D and User E both have accounts, not currently friends or matched

**Steps:**
1. Login as User D
2. Navigate to Add Friend, search for User E, tap "Add"
3. **Expected:** Button changes to "Requested"
4. Check Supabase: friendship (D→E, pending)
5. Login as User E
6. Navigate to Add Friend, search for User D
7. **Expected:** User D appears with "Accept" button (because D→E is pending_received from E's perspective)

---

### 25. Friends List with Availability

**Preconditions:** User A has at least two friends (matched or manually added). One friend has set a work_intent for today, the other has not.

**Setup:**
1. Ensure User B has a work_intent for today (e.g., "Writing blog posts")
2. Ensure User C does NOT have a work_intent for today

**Steps:**
1. Login as User A
2. Navigate to Profile → My Friends
3. **Expected:** Both User B and User C appear in the friends list
4. Verify User B shows:
   - Profile photo/initials

5. Verify User C shows:
   - Profile photo/initials
   - Name
   - No green dot
   - "Not available today" in muted italic text
6. Tap User B
7. **Expected:** Navigates to ChatScreen with User B (Matches tab, Chat screen)
8. Verify chat opens with correct match and user info
9. Press back → returns to Matches list (not Friends screen, since we navigated cross-tab)
10. Pull-to-refresh on Friends screen
11. **Expected:** List refreshes (loading indicator briefly visible)

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|

## Phase 5 Debugging Tips

### Check Friend Functions
```sql
-- Test send_friend_request directly
SELECT send_friend_request('USER_A_UUID'::uuid, 'USER_B_UUID'::uuid);

-- Test respond_to_friend_request
SELECT respond_to_friend_request('FRIENDSHIP_UUID'::uuid, 'RECIPIENT_UUID'::uuid, 'accept');

-- Test get_pending_requests_count
SELECT get_pending_requests_count('USER_UUID'::uuid);

-- Check all friendships
SELECT f.id, f.status, f.created_at,
       p1.name as requester_name, p2.name as recipient_name
FROM friendships f
JOIN profiles p1 ON f.requester_id = p1.id
JOIN profiles p2 ON f.recipient_id = p2.id
ORDER BY f.created_at DESC;

-- Check if match was created on accept
SELECT m.id, p1.name as user1, p2.name as user2
FROM matches m
JOIN profiles p1 ON m.user1_id = p1.id
JOIN profiles p2 ON m.user2_id = p2.id
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC;

-- Search users (simulate client search)
SELECT id, name, username, email, phone_number
FROM profiles
WHERE username ILIKE '%query%'
   OR email ILIKE '%query%'
   OR phone_number ILIKE '%query%';

-- Check phone number column exists
SELECT phone_number FROM profiles LIMIT 5;
```

### Common Phase 5 Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "function send_friend_request does not exist" | Run `supabase/006_friendships_table.sql` |
| "Cannot send request to this user" | Check friendships table for existing declined row |
| Match not created on accept | Verify `create_match` is called inside `respond_to_friend_request` |
| Badge not showing on Profile tab | Check `getPendingRequestsCount` call in MainTabs on focus |
| Search returns no results | Check ILIKE wildcards and that profile fields are populated |
| Friends list empty despite matches existing | Check `fetchFriends` query filters (should return ALL matches) |
| Cross-tab navigation crash | Verify Chat screen params match `MatchesStackParamList` |
| Phone number not saving | Check profiles UPDATE RLS policy allows `auth.uid() = id` |
| "Already friends" error on add | Users are already matched via swiping — expected behavior |

# Phase 5: Profile Redesign — Verification Flows

**Added:** 2026-02-16

---

## Database Setup (Profile Redesign)

Before testing profile redesign features, run the SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

7. `supabase/007_profile_photos.sql` — profile_photos table, profile columns (tagline, currently_working_on, work, school), avatars bucket, storage policies

After running, verify:
1. Go to Table Editor → verify `profile_photos` table exists
2. Go to Table Editor → verify `profiles` table has `tagline`, `currently_working_on`, `work`, `school` columns
3. Go to Authentication → Policies → verify RLS policies on `profile_photos` table
4. Go to Storage → verify `avatars` bucket exists (public)
5. Go to Storage → Policies → verify read/write policies on `avatars` bucket

---

### 27. Verify Profile Redesign Database

**Preconditions:** SQL migration `007_profile_photos.sql` executed

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run: `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';`
3. **Expected:** `profile_photos` listed alongside existing tables
4. Run: `SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name IN ('tagline', 'currently_working_on', 'work', 'school');`
5. **Expected:** Four rows, all type `text`
6. Run: `SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'profile_photos';`
7. **Expected:** Columns: `id` (uuid), `user_id` (uuid), `photo_url` (text), `position` (integer), `created_at` (timestamp with time zone)
8. Run: `SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'profile_photos';`
9. **Expected:** RLS policies for SELECT (public), INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (owner only)
10. Test inserting a profile photo directly:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO profile_photos (user_id, photo_url, position)
    VALUES ('USER_UUID'::uuid, 'https://example.com/test.jpg', 0);
    ```
11. **Expected:** Row inserted successfully
12. Test unique constraint:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO profile_photos (user_id, photo_url, position)
    VALUES ('USER_UUID'::uuid, 'https://example.com/test2.jpg', 0);
    ```
13. **Expected:** Error — duplicate key violation (user_id, position)
14. Verify storage bucket:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'avatars';
    ```
15. **Expected:** One row, public = true

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| profile_photos table not found | SQL not run | Execute `007_profile_photos.sql` |
| Storage bucket not found | Bucket creation failed or needs Dashboard | Create `avatars` bucket via Supabase Dashboard → Storage |
| Storage upload fails | Storage policies not applied | Apply storage policies via Dashboard → Storage → Policies |
| Profile columns missing | ALTER TABLE failed | Check for syntax errors in migration SQL |

---

### 28. New User Onboarding with Photo Upload

**Preconditions:** Fresh account (not onboarded)

**Steps:**
1. Create a new account (email + password)
2. Complete Step 1 — enter name
3. Complete Step 2 — select work type
4. Complete Step 3 — select interests
5. **Expected:** Step 4 appears: "Add a photo" with PhotoSlots grid
6. **Expected:** "Get Started" button is disabled (no photo uploaded yet)
7. Tap the primary photo slot
8. **Expected:** Photo picker opens (device library)
9. Select a photo
10. **Expected:** Photo appears in the primary slot
11. **Expected:** "Get Started" button becomes enabled
12. Tap "Get Started"
13. **Expected:** Navigated to main app (Discover tab)
14. Check Supabase `profile_photos` table
15. **Expected:** One row with user_id, position=0, photo_url pointing to avatars bucket
16. Check Supabase `profiles` table
17. **Expected:** `photo_url` matches the uploaded photo URL, `onboarding_complete = true`

**Common Failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Photo picker doesn't open | expo-image-picker not installed | Run `npx expo install expo-image-picker` |
| Photo picker permissions denied | iOS permissions not configured | Check app.json for photo library permission |
| Upload fails | Storage bucket not configured | Check avatars bucket exists and policies are set |
| "Get Started" always disabled | Photo upload state not tracked | Check state management in onboarding Step 4 |

## Profile Redesign Debugging Tips

### Check Profile Data
```sql
-- Check profile fields
SELECT id, name, tagline, currently_working_on, work, school, work_type, photo_url
FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'USER_UUID';

-- Check profile photos
SELECT * FROM profile_photos WHERE user_id = 'USER_UUID' ORDER BY position;

-- Check storage files
SELECT name, bucket_id, created_at
FROM storage.objects
WHERE bucket_id = 'avatars'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Common Profile Redesign Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Photo picker doesn't open | Run `npx expo install expo-image-picker`, check iOS permissions |
| Upload fails with 403 | Check storage bucket policies, verify user is authenticated |
| Photo URL returns 404 | Check file was actually uploaded, verify bucket is public |
| Profile changes don't persist | Check updateProfile query, verify RLS allows UPDATE |
| Onboarding stuck on Step 3 | Check totalSteps changed from 3 to 4 |
| EditProfile save doesn't navigate back | Check goBack() called after updateProfile resolves |
| Tagline not on SwipeCard | Check SwipeCard.tsx was modified to include tagline |
